# Arduino + OSX + C++11 + Make Boilerplate

This repro is a boilerplate template for starting new arduino projects
on osx.  It could probably be easily adapted to other osx by modifying the
Makefile paths appropriately.

## Installation

1. Clone the repro
2. git submodule init
3. git submodule update
4. brew install avr-libc (or use macports)
